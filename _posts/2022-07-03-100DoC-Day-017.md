### Things to remember

- "pass" use 
- PascalCase - it is one of many ways to name objects. E.g.: PascalIsCool
- camelCase - firstLetterIsLowerCase
- snake_case - here_we_use_underscores :)
- if class is bleuprint for the object than
- what should happen when our object is being constructed
- initializing the objet
