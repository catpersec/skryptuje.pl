In today's lesson I learned about the most important decision making tool in programmin which is IF statement.



&nbsp;
### If statement

The most crucial decision making tool in Python (or any other programming language) is **if statement**.

    </a>
</div>

###### Example:
{% highlight python %}
# num = -4.5

if num > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif num == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative number")
{% endhighlight %}

#### Comparison operators

Operators which are used if you want to compare a value with another value.

&nbsp;
#### Nested if / else

It is possible to use conditional statement in a manner as shown below

    </a>
</div>


&nbsp;
#### Logical operators

Logical operators are used to connect more relational operations to form a complex expression called logical expression. A value obtained by evaluating a logical expression is always logical, i.e. either True or False.

&nbsp;
### Modulo

The modulo (or "modulus" or "mod") is the remainder after dividing one number by another.
In Python performed using:

> %


&nbsp;
### Other important functions

#### Count(value)

> The count() method returns the number of elements with the specified value.

###### Example:
{% highlight python %}
# create a list
numbers = [2, 3, 5, 2, 11, 2, 7]

# check the count of 2
count = numbers.count(2)

print('Count of 2:', count)

# Output: Count of 2: 3
{% endhighlight %}


#### Lower(string object)
> The lower() method converts all uppercase characters in a string into lowercase characters and returns it.

###### Example:
{% highlight python %}
message = 'PYTHON IS FUN'

# convert message to lowercase
print(message.lower())

# Output: python is fun
{% endhighlight %}

### Complete code from the final project of the lesson

Day 2 final project code.

{% highlight python %}
print("Welcome to Treasure Island.")
print("Your mission is to find the treasure.")

choice1 = input('You\'re at a cross road. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right" \n').lower()
if choice1 == "left":
  choice2 = input('You\'ve come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to swim across. \n').lower()
  if choice2 == "wait":
    choice3 = input("You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose? \n").lower()
    if choice3 == "red":
      print("It's a room full of fire. Game Over.")
    elif choice3 == "yellow":
      print("You found the treasure! You Win!")
    elif choice3 == "blue":
      print("You enter a room of beasts. Game Over.")
    else:
      print("You chose a door that doesn't exist. Game Over.")
  else:
    print("You get attacked by an angry trout. Game Over.")
else:
  print("You fell into a hole. Game Over.")
{% endhighlight %}
